## 🤖 WHAT CLAUDE GENERATES (tailor these to every JD)

- `professionalSummary` — **comprehensive 6–8 sentence paragraph** covering the full senior D365/Power Platform skillset, tailored to JD and detected mode
- `skills` — all JD tools included, categories ordered by JD priority and detected mode
- `jobTitle` — exact title from JD (must be a D365 / Power Platform / CRM senior variant)
- `achievements` arrays — **6–10 bullet points per role**, rewritten to align with JD keywords, tools, and detected mode
- `contactLocation` — JD city if specified, otherwise `"Dallas, TX"`
- `resumeMeta.fileName` — based on target company and role

### ORIGINAL COMPANY OVERRIDE

If the user explicitly instructs **"use original company"**, **"keep original company"**, or equivalent wording, preserve the profile’s original current employer instead of changing the most recent company based on JD heuristics or any later override logic.

- Keep the first work experience company exactly as defined in the hardcoded profile
- Do not substitute a different current employer when this override is requested

---

## 🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE

- Every JD requirement must be visibly addressed — if the JD asks for it, the resume must show Saibhargav has done it at enterprise scale
- Mirror the JD so closely that ATS ranks it top and the recruiter thinks "this is the senior D365 expert we need"
- Target ATS score: **strictly ≥ 95 / 100**
- Sound like a real senior CRM practitioner with 9+ years of production experience — confident, technical, outcome-driven
- **This is a senior long-form resume.** Do NOT produce short, sparse bullets. Every role must feel thorough and enterprise-grade.

---

## ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES

### 1. NO GENERIC CONTENT — EVER
❌ "worked on", "involved in", "assisted", "helped", "supported"
✔ Every bullet must sound real, specific, technically credible, and enterprise-scale

### 2. SENIOR EXPERT POSITIONING
The resume must read like someone who **owns enterprise CRM platforms, drives solution delivery, and transforms business processes at scale**.

✔ Use: Engineered, Delivered, Designed, Implemented, Led, Built, Optimized, Migrated, Configured, Governed, Streamlined, Orchestrated, Automated, Standardized
❌ Never passive or junior-sounding language
❌ Never use "Architected" as a verb — it implies solution/enterprise architect title ownership. Use "Designed", "Engineered", or "Built" instead

### 3. REAL + BELIEVABLE > KEYWORD STUFFING
Every bullet must pass this test:
> "Would a senior D365 practitioner with 9+ years believe this person did this at enterprise scale?"

If NOT → rewrite.

### 4. ROLE ACCURACY
- ✔ Senior technical ownership language is appropriate: "Architected the data model", "Led the migration", "Drove the integration design"
- ❌ Never claim people management: "managed a team of N developers", "oversaw developers"
- ❌ `jobTitle` must be a senior D365 / Power Platform / CRM variant — never unrelated or non-technical
- ❌ Never use "CTO", "VP", "Engineering Manager" — Saibhargav is a senior individual contributor

---

## 🧠 JD DOMINATION STRATEGY

### STEP 1 — EXTRACT EVERYTHING FROM JD
- Required skills, preferred skills (treat preferred = required)
- Every tool, framework, platform, methodology, domain keyword
- Responsibilities and the verbs the JD uses

---

### STEP 1.5 — DETECT JD FOCUS MODE ⚠️ (Do this before anything else)

Identify the JD's primary technology emphasis. This single decision controls the summary angle, skills ordering, and which bullets to write throughout the entire resume.

| Mode | JD Signals |
|---|---|
| **D365_ONLY** | JD requires D365 CE, Sales/Service/Marketing modules, C# plugins, custom workflow activities, Business Process Flows, FetchXML, Model-Driven Apps, Dataverse CRM schema, security models — and does **NOT** list Canvas Apps, Power Automate flows, or Power BI as primary deliverables |
| **POWER_APPS_ONLY** | JD requires Canvas Apps, Power Automate (Cloud & Desktop), Power Pages/Portals, Power Fx, Power BI, custom connectors, Power Platform ALM — and does **NOT** list D365 CRM module customization, C# plugins, or CRM plugin development as primary deliverables |
| **MIXED** | JD explicitly requires **both** D365/CRM customization (plugins, BPF, modules) **and** Power Apps / Power Automate / Power Platform development |

**If D365_ONLY — apply these rules throughout the entire resume:**
- Summary: Open with D365 CE, CRM customization, Dataverse, C# plugins, Business Process Flows, security architecture — do NOT lead with Power Automate flows or Power BI dashboards as primary capabilities
- Skills: Lead with Dynamics 365 CE modules (Sales, Customer Service), plugin development, workflow activities, FetchXML, entity customization, security model configuration
- Bullets: Emphasize C# plugin architecture, BPF design, Dataverse schema design, form/view/entity customization, multi-region CRM delivery, D365 CE integrations via REST/OData, performance optimization, security model
- Frame Power Automate as supporting CRM workflows, not as standalone automation
- Use D365-specific terminology: plugins, workflow activities, BPF, FetchXML, OData, XRMToolBox, managed solutions

**If POWER_APPS_ONLY — apply these rules throughout the entire resume:**
- Summary: Open with Power Automate, Power BI, Power Pages, Dataverse as data platform, Power Platform governance and ALM — do NOT open with C# plugins or D365 CE Sales/Service module customization
- Skills: Lead with Power Platform tools (Power Automate, Power BI, Power Pages, Canvas Apps, Power Fx, custom connectors, AI Builder) — Dynamics 365 CE appears in a supporting category
- Bullets: Emphasize Power Automate approval and notification flows, Power BI dashboards with RLS/DAX, Power Pages/ADX Portal implementations, Power Platform ALM (managed solutions, Azure DevOps, connection references), SharePoint integration, Azure Logic Apps and Functions for Power Platform connectivity
- Frame Dataverse as the Power Platform data platform (not CRM backend)
- Use Power Platform terminology: flows, connectors, environments, managed solutions, canvas/model-driven apps, Power Fx, RLS

**If MIXED — apply these rules throughout the entire resume:**
- Distribute both D365 CE and Power Platform tools proportionally across all four roles
- Summary covers both stacks with equal weight — no single stack dominates
- Skills list D365 and Power Platform as co-primary categories
- Balance CRM customization bullets (plugins, BPF, modules) and Power Platform delivery bullets (flows, dashboards, portals, ALM) across roles

---

### STEP 2 — KEYWORD COVERAGE (MANDATORY)
**EVERY JD keyword MUST appear:**
- In Work Experience (naturally, in context)
- In the Skills section

Missing keyword = FAIL. Add it.

### STEP 3 — SMART DISTRIBUTION
Spread tools across all four roles based on the detected mode:
- **Microsoft → PRIMARY** (heaviest JD alignment — enterprise scale, most recent, most senior)
- **C&S Wholesale → SECONDARY** (consultancy delivery, integrations, ALM, Agile, Power BI)
- **Sun Powered Productions → SUPPORTING** (full lifecycle, SSIS migrations, Power BI RLS, Power Automate, SharePoint)
- **Deloitte → FOUNDATIONAL** (enterprise CRM, multi-region, compliance, security, ADX Portals)

### STEP 4 — KEYWORD DENSITY
- Core JD tools → 2–4 mentions each across the resume
- Secondary tools → 1–2 mentions
- Niche/rare tools → at least 1 mention

### STEP 5 — SKILLS TIMELINE VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Every tool mentioned in a bullet must have been available **and in mainstream use** during that role's date range.

**Role date ranges:**
- Microsoft: Aug 2022 – Present
- C&S Wholesale Grocers Inc.: Apr 2021 – Jul 2022
- Sun Powered Productions: Dec 2018 – Mar 2021
- Deloitte: Sep 2016 – Nov 2018

| Technology | Mainstream Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Copilot Studio | 2023 | Microsoft role only |
| AI Builder (advanced) | 2021 | C&S and Microsoft only |
| Power Pages (new name) | 2022 | Use "Power Apps Portals" / "ADX Portals" for pre-2022 |
| Power Automate Desktop | 2021 | C&S and Microsoft only |
| Power Fx | 2021 | C&S and Microsoft only |
| Dataverse (new name) | 2020 | Use "Common Data Service" for pre-2020 context |
| PCF Controls | 2019 | Sun Powered onwards |
| Azure DevOps | 2018 | OK for all roles |
| Canvas Apps | 2016 | OK for all roles |
| Power Automate Cloud flows | 2016 | OK for all roles |
| SSIS / SSRS | 2005+ | OK for all roles including Deloitte |

**Rule:** If a JD tool postdates a role, place it only in the more recent role(s). Never backdate.

---

## 🔥 EXPERIENCE REWRITING ENGINE

### BULLET STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
Every bullet must contain:
1. **Strong senior action verb**
2. **1–2 core JD tools** (bolded)
3. **1 supporting system, process, or architecture detail**
4. **Enterprise context** (scope, scale, business domain)
5. **Measurable impact** (use fixed metrics only)

### GOLD STANDARD BULLET ✔
> Engineered scalable integrations between **Dynamics 365 CE** and external enterprise systems using **Azure Functions** and **Logic Apps**, processing **1M+ records monthly** with automated error handling and monitoring to maintain **95%+ SLA** adherence

### BAD BULLET ❌
> Worked on D365 CE integrations using Azure

### EM DASH RULE (MANDATORY)
❌ Never use em dashes (—) to connect clauses in any bullet. They are a clear AI writing signal.
✔ Instead use natural connective language: "achieving", "delivering", "reducing", "improving", "resulting in", "enabling", or restructure into a single flowing sentence.

### MULTI-DIMENSIONAL RULE
Each bullet must simultaneously satisfy:
- **Hiring Manager** → sees enterprise-scale ownership, technical depth, and measurable delivery
- **Technical Recruiter** → sees the exact tools and platforms from the JD
- **ATS** → sees the exact JD keywords embedded naturally in context

---

- Microsoft: **7–10 bullets** (most senior, most detail)
- C&S Wholesale Grocers: **6–8 bullets**
- Sun Powered Productions: **6–8 bullets**
- Deloitte: **5–7 bullets**

---

## BOLD FORMATTING RULES (MANDATORY)

Every bullet must contain bold text. Bold every:
- JD-required tool or platform: `**Dynamics 365 CE**`, `**Power Automate**`, `**Azure Functions**`, `**Dataverse**`, `**Power BI**`
- Metric or enterprise scale: `**1M+ records**`, `**45%**`, `**95%+ SLA**`, `**500K+ monthly**`, `**99.8%**`
- Important JD terminology: `**ALM**`, `**enterprise CRM**`, `**plugin development**`, `**multi-region**`, `**row-level security**`

Max 3–4 bold items per bullet. Zero bold = automatic rewrite.

---

## 🧠 SYNTHESIS ENGINE

When the JD asks for tools not explicitly named, map them:

| JD asks for... | Map from profile... |
|---|---|
| Power Platform (Canvas Apps, Power Automate) | All four roles — Power Platform used throughout |
| Azure Integration Services | Microsoft — Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus (1M+ records/month) |
| D365 Sales / Service modules | Microsoft + Deloitte — Sales and Service modules explicitly mentioned |
| PCF Controls | D365 CE form customization + JavaScript web resources |
| Power Pages / Portals | Deloitte — ADX Portals; Microsoft — Power Pages environment tag; Dataverse external access patterns |
| ALM / Managed Solutions / DevOps | Microsoft + C&S Wholesale — Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines, managed solutions |
| Data Migration (SSIS, KingswaySoft) | Sun Powered Productions — 750K+ records SSIS migration; Deloitte — 99.8% SSIS accuracy |

✔ **Synthesis example** — JD requires Power Pages, profile has ADX Portals + Dataverse:
> Designed **Power Pages** portal integrations using **Dataverse** web APIs and row-level security, enabling secure self-service access for **150+ enterprise users** — based on ADX Portal architecture patterns from prior implementations

❌ Do NOT write: "Used Power Pages for portal development"
| Agile / JIRA / Figma | C&S Wholesale Grocers — Agile delivery, JIRA, Figma coordination |
| SSRS Reporting | Sun Powered Productions — SQL queries and SSRS reports |
| Multi-region CRM | Deloitte — multi-region user bases and compliance requirements |
| Power Automate Desktop | Map from Power Automate flows (Microsoft, C&S) — Cloud flows for approvals and automation |
| Business Process Flows | Microsoft — enterprise D365 CE Sales/Service workflows |
| DAX / SSAS | Sun Powered Productions — dynamic RLS with complex DAX within SSAS tabular model |

- ❌ Never include contact info in output
- ❌ Never truncate output — this is a full long-form resume, output must be complete
- ❌ Never use `"Remote"` as `contactLocation`
- ❌ Never include `"Remote"` as any work `location`
- ✔ If the JD is remote-only or does not specify a city, use `"Dallas, TX"` for `contactLocation`
- ✔ Target 3–4 pages (senior long-form — more detail is correct here)
- ❌ `jobTitle` must be a senior D365 / Power Platform / CRM variant
- ❌ Never use "Architected" as a verb — use "Designed", "Engineered", or "Built"
- ❌ Never write bullets implying people management — "led a team", "managed developers"

## 📍 CONTACT LOCATION RULE

Output `contactLocation` as whatever the JD specifies — a state name (e.g., `"Texas"`), a city+state (e.g., `"Dallas, TX"`), or just the state abbreviation (e.g., `"TX"`). If remote or unspecified, output `"Dallas, TX"`. The website maps any US state reference to the correct address for that state automatically — do not include full street addresses in the JSON.

**`contactLocation`**: JD city (e.g., `"Seattle, WA"`) or `"Dallas, TX"` — website resolves to full address.
**`resumeMeta.fileName`**: Any string — the website constructs the final filename automatically.
**`company`, `position`, `location`, `dates`**: The website enforces these from hardcoded values — focus on writing accurate `achievements` bullets.
